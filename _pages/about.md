I am a PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), advised by [Prof. Fangzhen Lin](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~flin/). My research focuses on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Reasoning**, and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, with a particular emphasis on advancing the capabilities of LLMs in mathematical and coding tasks. I am fortunate to be supported by the **Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)**, with only 300 awardees across Hong Kong each year.  

My recent work includes developing RL-based approaches to enhance LLM reasoning, as seen in projects like [Autocode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00691), [ACECoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01718), and [HTL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15729). For a comprehensive list of my publications, please visit [my publications]().

Prior to joining HKUST, I worked as a **Researcher at INF Technology**, advised by [Dr. Wei Chu](https://weichu.github.io/), and as an **AI Engineer at Alibaba**, under the guidance of [Dr. Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/). These experiences allowed me to deepen my expertise in AI and machine learning while contributing to impactful industry projects.

I completed my **Master’s degree in Computer Science** at **ShanghaiTech University** in 2022, where I was supervised by [Prof. Xuming He](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/hexm/index.html). During this time, I was honored to be recognized as one of the **Outstanding Graduates of Shanghai** (top 1% province-wide). I hold a **Bachelor’s degree** from **Wuhan University**, where I was awarded the prestigious **National Scholarship** (top 0.2% nation-wide) in 2017.
