I am a PhD student at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), advised by [Prof. Fangzhen Lin](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~flin/), and in close collaboration with [Prof. Wenhu Chen](https://wenhuchen.github.io/) at University of Waterloo. My research focuses on **Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, **Reasoning**, and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, with a particular emphasis on advancing the capabilities of LLMs in mathematical and coding tasks. I am fortunate to be supported by the **Hong Kong PhD Fellowship Scheme (HKPFS)**, with only 300 awardees across Hong Kong each year.  

My recent work includes developing RL-based approaches to enhance LLM reasoning, as seen in projects like [Autocode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00691), [ACECoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01718), and [HTL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15729). For a comprehensive list of my publications, please visit [my publications](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=V96YGIMAAAAJ&hl=en).

Prior to joining HKUST, I worked as a **Researcher at INF Technology**, advised by [Dr. Wei Chu](https://weichu.github.io/), and as an **AI Engineer at Alibaba**, under the guidance of [Dr. Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/). These experiences allowed me to deepen my expertise in AI and machine learning while contributing to impactful industry projects.

I completed my **Master’s degree in Computer Science** at **ShanghaiTech University** in 2022, where I was supervised by [Prof. Xuming He](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/hexm/index.html). During this time, I was honored to be recognized as one of the **Outstanding Graduates of Shanghai** (top 1% province-wide). I hold a **Bachelor’s degree** from **Wuhan University**, where I was awarded the prestigious **National Scholarship** (top 0.2% nation-wide) in 2017.

<!-- 
I have a broad research experience in machine learning, including
Reinforcement Learning, Variational Bayes, Vison and Language. <ins>Currently, I am super excited about research on Generative AI, and I am looking for opportunities / research collaborations on relevant topics.</ins> For more details, please check out my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HazekiahWon/helios2/master/assets/Research_CV.pdf). -->

Notice
======
I am actively seeking research collaboration and research opportunities in VLMs, RL and agents. Let's make real impacts to both the industry and the academia! 

News
======
We release a new diffusion quantization method: [TR-DQ](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06564).

We release [Autocode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00691) on metacognitive tool-use LLMs for math, and [ACECoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01718) for large-scale test-case synthesis for coder RL training.

Our paper [RenderWorld](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11356) on 3D world models is accepted to ICRA 2025. Congrats to Yihua and Ziyan!

Our [V-PETL Benchmark](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/935de67d1a033fd517cb49d192b5c008-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks_Track.pdf) is accepted to NeurIPS 2025.

Our [HTL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15729) on tool-integrated reasoning for math is accepted to EMNLP 2025.
