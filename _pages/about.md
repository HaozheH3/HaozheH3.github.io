I am currently a PhD student at HKUST, advised by [Fangzhen Lin](https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/~flin/). I am lucky to receive the generous funding of HKPFS (1/300 in Hong Kong). My research interest centered around Large Language Models, Reasoning, and Reinforcement Learning. My recent work includes RL for LLM reasoning in math and coding [Autocode](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00691), [ACECoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01718), [HTL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15729). For more details, please check [my publications]() for details. 

Before that, I spent a year working as a researcher at INF Technology, advised by [Wei Chu](https://weichu.github.io/), and one year as an AI engineer at Alibaba, advised by [Chao Du](https://duchao0726.github.io/).
I finished my master's study in Computer Science at *ShanghaiTech University* in 2022, supervised by [Xuming He](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/hexm/index.html).
At that time I was also elected as
one of the <ins>Outstanding Graduates of Shanghai</ins> (1% province-wide).
I received a Bachelor's degree from *Wuhan University* in 2019, where I earned the prestigious <ins>National Scholarship</ins> (0.2% nation-wide) in 2017.

<!-- 
I have a broad research experience in machine learning, including
Reinforcement Learning, Variational Bayes, Vison and Language. <ins>Currently, I am super excited about research on Generative AI, and I am looking for opportunities / research collaborations on relevant topics.</ins> For more details, please check out my [CV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HazekiahWon/helios2/master/assets/Research_CV.pdf). -->
